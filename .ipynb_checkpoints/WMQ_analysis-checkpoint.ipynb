The logic behind the limits of this dataset is that the API allows researchers to request data for up to 1000 articles at a time, and this search gave me a dataset of n =973.  \n",

    "The JSTOR API sent me a series of XML files which I have unzipped and stored in a file (called ```/data```) in the same directory/repository as this jupyter notebook.  My first experiment is to try to use xmltree to parse some of this data."
