# WMQ_titles
Analyze 30 years of titles in the scholarly journal, William and Mary Quarterly, based on data from JSTOR

## Prospectus
This project will take a sample of 30 years of titles and analyze the contents of the titles using some basic parsing and text analysis methods.  In particular, the project will
* Make a SQL database storing the data from the xml output from the JSTOR API
* Perform basic word frequency analysis on word titles
* Parse titles using regex analysis to find years; what are the most common years mentioned in WMQ titles?
* etc.  

The project will use Python, and jupyter notebooks.
